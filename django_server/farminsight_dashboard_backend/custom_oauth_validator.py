        Some RFC 7662 implementations (including this one) use a Bearer token while others use Basic

        or the introspection_credentials.

        If the resulting access_token identifies a username (e.g. Authorization Code grant), add
        that user to the UserModel. Also cache the access_token up until its expiry time or a
        configured maximum time.

            RELEVANT CONSIDERATIONS FOR RE-ENABLING THIS:            
            
            When we started out the Userprofile model was way more limited since we didn't have to store any additional 
            information like a password hash. Changing the class used to represent the user in django was not very straight forward so instead
            we changed the model to support the whole spectrum used by the default django login system that we're currently using.
            
            I think switching back the cleanest way will be to keep using the current model and keep all the existing entries.
            The way to do this would be to add an "externalId" field to the userprofile model and use that one to place the
            id from the external service (content["id"]) and have a mode where checking for a userprofile entry with the 
            same email and use that one instead of creating a new entry.
            
            Also when setting the fields of a newly external userprofile it would also be best to keep using email as the username
            during the auto creation, keeping the integrity of the database entries in tact for either mode of operation (or even using both simultaneously)
